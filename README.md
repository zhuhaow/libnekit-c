# libnekit

## Goal
The goal of `libnekit` is to provide a cross-platform version of [`NEKit`](https://github.com/zhuhaow/NEKit). This should be much more efficient than the swift version due to the limitation of swift when dealing with I/O heavy tasks.

The development of [`NEKit`](https://github.com/zhuhaow/NEKit) will be abandoned when this library is ready, and the support on darwin will be provided with a swift binding.
